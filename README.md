# Norima-ship

A "Battleship"-style game where we can explore libraries we've been dying to try while doing something during this pandemic!

## Setup

Currently this thing doesn't do much and, as a result, doesn't require much setup. All you have to do is:

- clone
- `npm ci`
- and run via `node index.js`

You now have a server humming away in the back that you should be able to hit at `http://localhost:3000`.

## AWS

Yes! We have a free-tier server for fun times. Ask me for the key/creds so that you can work with the AWS infrastructure.
